# Security Policy

## Overview

The Smart Contract Auditor Agent is designed with security as a top priority. This document outlines our security practices, data handling policies, and guidelines for responsible disclosure.

## Data Protection

### Contract Code Handling
- **Local Processing Only**: All smart contract analysis is performed locally within the container
- **No External Transmission**: Contract code is never sent to external services or APIs
- **No Persistent Storage**: Contract code is not stored permanently on disk
- **Memory Cleanup**: Contract data is cleared from memory after analysis

### Sensitive Information
- **Input Sanitization**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Log Redaction**: Sensitive data is automatically redacted from logs
- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive configuration uses environment variables
- **No Hardcoded Secrets**: No API keys or secrets in source code

## Security Features

### Input Validation
```typescript

const contractCodeSchema = z.string()
  .min(1, "Contract code cannot be empty")
  .max(50000, "Contract code too large (max 50KB)")
  .refine(validateSolidityCode, "Must be valid Solidity code");
```

### Rate Limiting
- Configurable rate limiting (default: 60 requests/minute)
- IP-based request tracking
- Graceful degradation under load

### Security Headers
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
- `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`
- `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'`

## Container Security

### Docker Best Practices
- Non-root user execution
- Minimal base image
- Multi-stage builds
- Health checks
- Resource limits

### Network Security
- Only necessary ports exposed (8080)
- No external network access required
- Local LLM processing

## Vulnerability Management

### Known Security Considerations
1. **Model Hallucinations**: AI models may produce false positives/negatives
2. **Resource Exhaustion**: Large contracts may consume significant resources
3. **Input Validation**: Malicious input could attempt code injection

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Multiple Analysis Tools**: Cross-validation using multiple detection methods
2. **Resource Limits**: Timeout and size limits on analysis
3. **Comprehensive Validation**: Multi-layer input sanitization

## Responsible Disclosure

### Reporting Security Issues
If you discover a security vulnerability, please:

1. **Do NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. Email security concerns to: [your-security-email]
3. Include detailed reproduction steps
4. Allow reasonable time for response (48-72 hours)

### What to Include
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested mitigation (if any)

## Security Testing

### Automated Tests
```bash

node tests/security.test.js

npm audit

npm run lint
```

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Input validation with malicious payloads
- [ ] Rate limiting functionality
- [ ] Log output for sensitive data leaks
- [ ] Container security scanning
- [ ] Network isolation verification

## Compliance

### Data Privacy
- No personal data collection
- No tracking or analytics
- Local processing only
- GDPR compliant by design

### Industry Standards
- Follows OWASP security guidelines
- Implements secure coding practices
- Regular dependency updates
- Security-first development approach

## Security Updates

### Dependency Management
- Regular security updates for all dependencies
- Automated vulnerability scanning
- Prompt patching of critical issues

### Version Control
- Signed commits for releases
- Security review for all changes
- Audit trail for modifications

## Configuration Security

### Environment Variables
```bash

NODE_ENV=production
ENABLE_RATE_LIMITING=true
MAX_REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE=60
LOG_LEVEL=warn

API_KEYS=use-environment-variables
SECRETS=use-secure-storage
```

### Production Deployment
- Use secrets management systems
- Enable all security features
- Monitor for suspicious activity
- Regular security assessments

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Procedure
1. **Immediate Response**: Isolate affected systems
2. **Assessment**: Determine scope and impact
3. **Containment**: Prevent further damage
4. **Recovery**: Restore normal operations
5. **Lessons Learned**: Update security measures
